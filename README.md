# 🩺 🫀 Heart Disease Predictor

📌 Overview

The Heart Disease Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict heart diseases based on patient health data. The model is trained using classification techniques to analyze symptoms/medical attributes and provide predictions that can assist in healthcare diagnostics.

This project is implemented in Python with Jupyter Notebook using PyCharm IDE and leverages machine learning libraries for training and evaluation.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning for health-related datasets

Training ML models for disease prediction

Model evaluation with accuracy and metrics

Exporting trained model for reuse

Easy-to-use interface via Jupyter Notebook

Deployment as a web app for user-friendly interaction

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.13.7

NumPy, Pandas → Data handling

Scikit-learn → Machine learning algorithms

Matplotlib, Seaborn → Visualization

Joblib → Model persistence

Streamlit → Model deployment
